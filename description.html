<h1>Description</h1>
<p>

This course examines how to program in C++ in a robust and safe manner. C++ is an unsafe programming language, meaning each programmer — not the programming language — must enforce basic invariants concerning abstractions and modularity. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the programming in C++ and its pitfalls; how standard libraries try to eliminate these pitfalls and fail; and what kind of tools programmers use to overcome the pitfalls.

The course reviews basics, including scoping, typing, and primitive data structures. Discusses data types (primitive, array, structure, class, string); addressing/parameter mechanisms (value, pointer, reference); stacks; queues; linked lists; binary trees; hash tables; and the design of classes and class inheritance, emphasizing single inheritance. Considers the instantiation of objects, the trade-offs of stack vs. heap allocation, and the design of constructors and destructors. Emphasizes the need for a strategy for dynamic memory management. Addresses function and operator overloading; templates, the Standard Template Library (STL), and the STL components (containers, generic algorithms, iterators, adaptors, allocators, function objects); streams; exception handling; and system calls for processes and threads.

                        <h1>Grading</h1>

                        <p>
				My general philosophy is: <strong>Your learn programming by doing programming!</strong> To that effect, you will have the opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge of the course materials through regular coding work. Some of the work may have to be completed in groups.
			</p>

			<p>The final grade for this course will be
                        calculated as a weighted average of scores for
                        practice activities, weekly homeworks, and final project, to be computed as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Practice Activities: 15%</li>
  <li>Assignments: 70%</li>
  <li>Final {Group} Project: 15% </li>
  <li> Note: These include 2.5% grade for feedback surveys (1.5% for PAs, 0.75% for Assign, 0.25% for Project) </li>
</ul>
</p>

</p>

<h2>Attendance</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>All students are required to attend all lectures.</li> 
<li><strong>Attendance will be required to receive any credit on practice activities.</strong></li>
<li>Sickness or other unplanned or extraordinary events happen and will be dealt with individually. It is your responsibility to ensure your situation is known to the Instructor as soon as reasonably possible. NU's <a

</ul>

<h2>Late Work and Makeup Policy</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>No Late work will be accepted for Practice Activities and Final Project. Assignments may be submitted late without excuse for up to 24 hrs but will incur a 15% penalty. No submission will be accepted after 24 hrs.</li>
	<li>For assignments and pratice activities, you will have ONE makeup opportunity {each} during the designated week (details will be announced in class during the second half of the semester). </li>

</ul>

<h2>Final Project</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Final Project is <strong>REQUIRED</strong> and failure to submit the project will result in ‘F’ for the course. There is no exam in this course.</li>
